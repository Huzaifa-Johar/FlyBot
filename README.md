# *Delivery Drone Simulator*



## *Team Information*
* **Project Title:** Delivery Drone Simulator  
* **Team Members:**  
* Talal Tahir – *Group Lead* 
* Huzaifa Johar  
* Shahzaib Ali 


## *Overview / Problem Description*
* This program simulates a delivery drone that checks battery, weather, and obstacles before delivering a package. 
* It shows how drones make decisions like delaying, canceling, or continuing a delivery based on real conditions.  
* Just like real life, this simulator: 
  - Checks battery level before flying. 
  - Responds to weather conditions like wind or rain.  
  - Detects obstacles such as trees or buildings.
  - Decides whether to delay or to abort the delivery.
* At the end, it shows a summary of how many deliveries were successful, failed, or delayed.
* It imitates the working of a real delivery drone in simulation form.

## *Program Design / Logic*
* **Main Functions Used:**
* weatherCheck() → Randomly sets weather (clear, windy, or rainy).
* obstacleDetect() → Randomly checks for obstacles.

* **Logic Flow:**
* The program starts and asks the user to press 1 to start the simulation or -1 to end the simulation.
* If the user presses 1 it asks for location of delivery.
* Each location has different battery consumption.
* Before moving forward it checks if battery is greater than 20,
* If battery is greater than 20 it first checks the weather condition and then obstacles.
* If battery is less than 20 it returns to base for recharge.
* After each delivery it displays the remaining battery level.
* **Random Events:**
* The program uses rand() to generate random numbers for weather and obstacles.
* The srand(time(NULL)) function ensures the program gets different random numbers each time it runs.     

* **Work Distribution:**
* *Shahzaib Ali* designed the main logic and structure of the program.
* *Talal Tahir* handled the coding part and implemented the core functions.
* *Huzaifa Johar* worked as the documentor and tester — he created the README file.

* **Future Improvements:**
* If we knew about classes, we could make the code easier and better to understand.
* It would also help us keep the code organized.
